## “CAZymes in <i>Maribacter dokdonensis</i> strain 62-1 from the Patagonian shelf: Genomics and physiology compared to related flavobacteria and a co-occurring <i>Alteromonas</i> strain”

Repo containing scripts & data to reproduce analysis & figures from Wolter et al. “CAZymes in <i>Maribacter dokdonensis</i> strain 62-1 from the Patagonian shelf: Genomics and physiology compared to related flavobacteria and a co-occurring <i>Alteromonas</i> strain” published at Frontiers in Microbiology (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.628055/abstract).

The repo contains [input files](./data) and [analysis code](./code), including the [annotated genome](./data/Maribacter621.gb) to complement the ongoing deposition at ENA.
